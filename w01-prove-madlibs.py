The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
{adjective} {animal} {verb} down the hallway. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before ift tried to {verb3}
right in front of my family.""")
# added paragraph
print(f"""
I was so embarrassed, but my family just {verb4}. My little sister even tried to {verb5} 
it, but it was too fast. We all had a good {verb4}, and I learned a valuable lesson:      
sometimes, the {adjective2} things happen when you least expect them.""")

print(f"""Later that day, I decided to tell my friend about my crazy encounter. I couldn't 
stop {verb6} about it. My friend thought it was so {adjective3} that they started
{verb7} with laughter. We spent the rest of the day sharing silly stories and {verb8}.
It was a great day, and I'll never forget the {adjective4} creature that caused all the fun.
